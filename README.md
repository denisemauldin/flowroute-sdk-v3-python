Requirements
------------

*   Flowroute [API credentials](https://manage.flowroute.com/accounts/preferences/api/)
*   [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/): `Python 2 >=2.7.9` or `Python 3 >=3.4`


* * *
Installation
------------

1. First, start a shell session and clone the Python library:
    * via HTTPS: `git clone https://github.com/flowroute/flowroute-sdk-v3-python.git`

    * via SSH: `git@github.com:flowroute/flowroute-sdk-v3-python.git`

2. Switch to the newly-created `flowroute-sdk-v3-python` directory. This version of the library comes with a requirements file listing the required Python libraries. See [Installing Packages](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/) to learn more about different ways to install Python packages. 

`pip` is already installed if you're using `Python 2 >=2.7.9` or `Python 3 >=3.4`. This version of the library has been tested with both `Python 2.7.9` and `Python 3.6.4` for Mac OS X. To see which version of `pip` is installed on your machine, run the following:

`pip --version`

Depending on your `pip` permissions, you may be required to preface each `pip` command with `sudo`. 

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

* * *
Usage
------------
In Flowroute's approach to building the Python library v3, HTTP requests are handled by controllers named after the API resources they represent: **Numbers**, **Routes**, **E911s**, **CNAMs**, and **Messages**. These controllers contain the methods used to perform messaging, number management, route management, E911 address management, and CNAM record management  within the Python library.

## Controllers

### NumbersController

Contains all of the methods necessary to search through Flowroute's phone number inventory, purchase a phone number, and review details of your account phone numbers.

*   [list\_available\_area\_codes()](#list_available_area_codes) \- Returns a list of all Numbering Plan Area (NPA) codes containing purchasable phone numbers. All request parameters are optional. If you don't specify a limit, results are limited to the first 10 items.
*   [list\_available\_exchange\_codes()](#list_available_exchange_codes) \- Returns a list of all Central Office (exchange) codes containing purchasable phone numbers. All request parameters are optional.
*   [search\_for\_purchasable\_phone\_numbers()](#search_for_purchasable_phone_numbers) \- Searches for purchasable phone numbers by state or rate center, or by your specified search value.
*   [purchase\_a\_phone\_number(purchasable\_number)](#purchase_a_phone_numbernumber_id) \- Lets you purchase a phone number from available Flowroute inventory.
*   [list\_account\_phone\_numbers()](#list_account_phone_numbers) \- Returns a list of all phone numbers currently on your Flowroute account. 
*   [list\_phone\_number\_details(number\_id)](#list_phone_number_detailsnumber_id) \- Returns details on a specific phone number associated with your account, including primary voice route, and failover voice route if previously configured.

### RoutesController
    
Contains the methods required to create new inbound routes, view all of your account routes, and update primary and failover voice routes for your phone numbers.
    
*   [create\_an\_inbound\_route(route\_body)](#create_an_inbound_routeroute_body) \- Creates a new inbound route which can then be assigned as either a primary or a failover voice route for a phone number on your account.
*   [list\_inbound\_routes()](#list_inbound_routes) \- Returns a list of your inbound routes. From the list, you can then select routes to use as the primary and failover voice routes for phone numbers on your account.
*   [update\_primary\_voice\_route(number\_id, route\_body)](#update_primary_voice_routenumber_id-route_body) \- Updates the primary voice route for a phone number. You must create the route first via the `create_an_inbound_route(routebody)` method.
*   [update\_failover\_voice\_route(number\_id, route\_body)](#update_failover_voice_routenumber_id-route_body) \- Updates the failover voice route for a phone number. You must create the route first via the `create_an_inbound_route(routebody)` method.

###   MessagesController
    
Contains the methods required to send an MMS or SMS, and review a specific Message Detail Record (MDR) or a set of messages.
    
*   [send\_a\_message(message\_body)](#send_a_messagemessage_body) \- Sends an SMS or MMS from a Flowroute long code or toll-free phone number to another valid phone number.
*   [look\_up\_a\_message\_detail\_record()](#look_up_a_message_detail_recordmessage_id) \- Searches for a specific message record ID and returns a Message Detail Record (in MDR2 format).
*   [look\_up\_a\_set\_of\_messages()](#look_up_a_set_of_messagesstart_date) \- Retrieves a list of Message Detail Records (MDRs) within a specified date range. Date and time is based on Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

### E911sController

Contains all of the methods necessary to create, update, and validate new and existing E911 addresses, retrieve all of the E911 records, activate and deactive E911 service for long code and toll-free numbers on your account, view all of the phone numbers associated with an E911 record, and remove an E911 address from your account once it is no longer associated with any of your Flowroute phone numbers.

*   [list\_e911s()](#list_e911s) \- Returns a list of all E911 records on your account by default. All request parameters are optional. If you don't specify a limit, results are limited to the first 10 items.
*   [get\_e911(e911\_id)](#get_e911e911_id) \- Returns details on a specified E911 record.
*   [validate\_address(e911\_attributes)](#validate_addresse911_attributes) \- Lets you validate new and existing E911 addresses on your account.
*   [create\_address(e911\_attributes)](#create_addresse911_attributes) \- Lets you create and validate an E911 address within the US and Canada which can then be assigned to any of the long code or tollÂ­free numbers on your account. To assign an E911 address to your number, see the [associate](#associatee911_id-number_id) method.
*   [update\_address(e911\_id, e911\_attributes)](#update_addresse911_id-e911_attributes) \- Lets you update and validate an existing E911 address on your account. You must create the E911 address first by following the [create\_address](#create_address) method. 
*   [associate(e911\_id, number\_id)](#associatee911_id-number_id) \- Lets you assign a valid E911 address to a specific long code or toll-free phone number in your account. This method calls an endpoint which does not return an error for subsequent attempts at associating a phone number with the same E911 record. The E911 record assignment charge only occurs on the first successful attempt. Note that you can later assign a different `e911_id` to the same phone number and will be charged accordingly.
*   [list\_dids\_for\_e911(e911\_id)](#list_dids_for_e911number_id) \- Returns a list of your Flowroute long code or toll-free phone numbers associated with a specified E911 record.
*   [disconnect(number\_id)](#disconnectnumber_id) \- Lets you deactivate the current E911 service for your phone number.
*   [delete\_address(e911\_id)](#delete_addresse911_id) \- Lets you delete an E911 address associated with your account. You must remove all phone number associations first before you can successfully delete the specified E911 record.

### CNAMsController

Contains all of the methods necessary to create and delete CNAM records, view all of the CNAM records associated with your account, filter for specific CNAM records by status, review CNAM record details, and assign and unassign CNAM records to your Flowroute long code phone numbers.
*   [list\_cnams()](#list_cnams) \- Returns a list of all CNAM records on your account by default. You can apply search filters using any of the available query parameters.
*   [get\_cnam(cnam\_id)](#get_cnam) \- Returns details pertaining to a specific CNAM record on your account, including long code numbers that are associated with the record.
*   [create\_cnam\_record(cnam\_value)](#create_cnam_record) \- Lets you create a Caller ID record for your account which can then be assigned to any of your long code numbers. To assign a CNAM record to your number, see the [associate\_cnam](#associate_cnam) method.
*   [associate\_cnam(cnam\_id, number\_id)](#associate) \- Lets you associate a CNAM record with a specified long code number on your account. Note that a CNAM record takes 1-2 days to be approved.
*   [unassociate(number\_id)](#disconnect) \- Lets you unassign a CNAM record associated with a specified long code number on your account without deleting the CNAM record itself.
*   [remove\_cnam(cnam\_id)](#remove_cnam) \- Lets you delete a CNAM record from your account. Note that this will automatically disassociate all numbers associated with the deleted CNAM record.

The following shows an example of a single Python file that imports the Flowroute API client and all the required modules. The Python library v3 comes with three example demo files &mdash; **number_route_message_demo.py**, **e911_demo.py**, **cnam_demo.py** &mdash; files that you can edit and run for demonstration and testing purposes.

```python
import pprint
import os
import json
import random
import string
from flowroutenumbersandmessaging.flowroutenumbersandmessaging_client import FlowroutenumbersandmessagingClient
```    
#### Credentials

Let's take **number_route_message_demo.py** as an example. In the file, replace `basic_auth_user_name` with your API Access Key and `basic_auth_password` with your API Secret Key from the [Flowroute Manager](https://manage.flowroute.com/accounts/preferences/api/). Note that in our example, we are accessing your Flowroute credentials as environment variables. To learn more about setting environment variables, see [How To Read and Set Environmental and Shell Variables](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-read-and-set-environmental-and-shell-variables-on-a-linux-vps).

```python
# Set up your api credentials and test mobile number for outbound SMS or MMS
basic_auth_user_name = os.environ.get('FR_ACCESS_KEY')
basic_auth_password = os.environ.get('FR_SECRET_KEY')
mobile_number = "YOUR_MOBILE_NUMBER"
```
#### Instantiate API Client and Controllers
Next, instantiate the API Client and its controllers. In the example below, we are only instantiating the necessary controllers for the Numbers,Messages, and Routes resources. The E911 and CNAM demo files come with their own set of required controllers to interact with the associated methods for E911 and CNAM record management.

```python
# Instantiate API client and create controllers for Numbers, Messages, and Routes
client = FlowroutenumbersandmessagingClient(basic_auth_user_name, basic_auth_password)
numbers_controller = client.numbers
routes_controller = client.routes
messages_controller = client.messages
```
## Methods
The following section will demonstrate the capabilities of Numbers v2, Messaging v2.1, E911 v2, and CNAM v2 that are wrapped in our Python library. Note that the example responses have been formatted using Mac's `pbpaste` and `jq`. To learn more, see [Quickly Tidy Up JSON from the Command Line](http://onebigfunction.com/vim/2015/02/02/quickly-tidying-up-json-from-the-command-line-and-vim/). 

### Number Management

The Flowroute Python library v3  allows you to make HTTP requests to the `numbers` resource of Flowroute API v2: `https://api.flowroute.com/v2/numbers`

#### list\_available\_area\_codes()

The method accepts `limit`, `offset`, and `max_setup_cost` as parameters which you can learn more about in the [API reference](https://developer.flowroute.com/api/numbers/v2.0/list-available-area-codes/).
    
##### Example Request
```python
print("--List Available Area Codes")
max_setup_cost = 3.25
limit = 3
offset = None
result = numbers_controller.list_available_area_codes(limit, offset, max_setup_cost)
pprint.pprint(result)
```

##### Example Response

On success, the HTTP status code in the response header is `200 OK` and the response body contains an array of area code objects in JSON format.

### Route Management

The Flowroute Python library v3 allows you to make HTTP requests to the `routes` resource of Flowroute API v2: `https://api.flowroute.com/v2/routes`
    
#### create\_an\_inbound\_route(route\_body) 

The method accepts the route object in JSON format as a parameter which you can learn more about in the [API reference](https://developer.flowroute.com/api/numbers/v2.0/create-an-inbound-route/). In the following example, we define a function to generate a six-character random string for our subdomain which we later concatenate with our example domain and assign as our `host` value. We use the same function to generate a unique `alias`.

##### Example Request
```python
print ("---Create an Inbound Route")
# Function to generate six-charac random string
def id_generator(size=6, chars=string.ascii_lowercase + string.digits):
    return ''.join(random.choice(chars) for _ in range(size))
new_route = id_generator() + '.sonsofodin.com'
alias = id_generator()
for i in range(6): alias += str(i)
print new_route
request_body = '{ \
  "data": { \
    "type": "route", \
    "attributes": { \
      "route_type": "host", \
      "value": "' + new_route +'", \
      "alias": "' + alias + '" \
    } \
  } \
}'
result = routes_controller.create_an_inbound_route(request_body)
print result
```

##### Example Response

On success, the HTTP status code in the response header is `201 Created` and the response body contains a route object in JSON format.

```
{
  "data": {
    "attributes": {
      "alias": "new route",
      "route_type": "host",
      "value": "il775u.sonsofodin.com"
    },
    "id": "98396",
    "links": {
      "self": "https://api.flowroute.com/routes/98396"
    },
    "type": "route"

#### update\_primary\_voice\_route(number\_id, route\_body)

The method accepts a phone number `id` and a route record object in JSON format as parameters which you can learn more about in the [API reference](https://developer.flowroute.com/api/numbers/v2.0/update-number-primary-voice-route/). In the following example, we extract the second route in our `list_inbound_routes` search result and assign it as the primary voice route for our previously declared `number_id`.

##### Example Request
```python
prirouteid = result['data'][1]['id']
request_body = '{ \
  "data": { \
    "type": "route", \
    "id": "' + str(prirouteid) +'" \
  } \
}'

print ("---Update Primary Voice Route")
result = routes_controller.update_primary_voice_route(number_id, request_body)
if result is None:
    print "204: No Content"
else:
    print result
```

##### Example Response

On success, the HTTP status code in the response header is `204 No Content` which means that the server successfully processed the request and is not returning any content.

`204: No Content`


#### update\_failover\_voice\_route(number\_id, route\_body)

The method accepts a phone number `id` and a route record object in JSON format as parameters which you can learn more about in the [API reference](https://developer.flowroute.com/api/numbers/v2.0/update-number-failover-voice-route/). In the following example, we extract the third and last route in our `list_inbound_routes` search result and assign it as the failover voice route for our previously declared `number_id`.

##### Example Request
```python
secrouteid = result['data'][2]['id']
request_body = '{ \
  "data": { \
    "type": "route", \
    "id": "' + str(secrouteid) +'" \
  } \
}'

print ("---Update Failover Voice Route")
result = routes_controller.update_failover_voice_route(number_id, request_body)
if result is None:
    print "204: No Content"
else:
    print result
```

##### Example Response

On success, the HTTP status code in the response header is `204 No Content` which means that the server successfully processed the request and is not returning any content.

`204: No Content`

In the following example, we are sending an MMS with a `gif` attachment from the previously declared `number_id` to your mobile number. 

##### Example Request
```python
request_body = '{ \
  "data": { \
    "type": "message", \
    "attributes": { \
      "to": "' + str(mobile_number) + '", \
      "from": "' + str(number_id) + '", \
      "body": "hello there", \
      "is_mms": "true", \
      "media_urls": ["http://s3.amazonaws.com/barkpost-assets/50+GIFs/37.gif"] \
    } \
  } \
}'

print ("---Send A Message")
result = messages_controller.send_a_message(request_body)
pprint.pprint(result)
```
Note that this function call is currently commented out. Uncomment to test the `send_a_message` method.

##### Example Response

### CNAM Record Management

The Flowroute Python library v3  allows you to make HTTP requests to the `cnams` resource of Flowroute API v2: `https://api.flowroute.com/v2/cnams`

| API Reference Pages |
| ------------------- |
| The E911 and CNAM API reference pages are currently restricted to our beta customers, which means that all API reference links below currently return a `404 Not Found`. They will be publicly available during our E911 and CNAM APIs GA launch in a few weeks. |

#### list\_cnams()

The method accepts `limit`, `offset`, and `is_approved` as parameters which you can learn more about in the [API reference](https://developer.flowroute.com/api/cnams/v2.0/list-account-cnam-records/).
    
##### Example Request
```python
print("--List CNAM Records")
limit = 10
offset = None
result = cnams_controller.list_cnams(limit, offset)
pprint.pprint(result)
```

##### Example Response

On success, the HTTP status code in the response header is `200 OK` and the response body contains an array of cnam objects in JSON format.

#### get_cnam(cnam_id)

The method accepts a CNAM record ID as a parameter which you can learn more about in the [API reference](https://developer.flowroute.com/api/cnams/v2.0/list-cnam-record-details/). In the example below, we query for approved CNAM records on your account and then extract the ID of the first record returned and retrieve the details of that specific CNAM record. 
    
##### Example Request
```
print("\n--List Approved CNAM Records")
result = cnams_controller.list_cnams(is_approved=True)
pprint.pprint(result)
if len(result['data']):
    cnam_id = result['data'][0]['id']

    print("\n--List CNAM Detail")
    result = cnams_controller.get_cnam(cnam_id)
    pprint.pprint(result)
```
##### Example Response

On success, the HTTP status code in the response header is `200 OK` and the response body contains a detailed cnam object in JSON format. For the sake of brevity, we will omit the response to the approved CNAM record query.
```

#### create_cnam_record(cnam_value)

The method accepts a Caller ID value as a parameter which you can learn more about in the [API reference](https://developer.flowroute.com/api/cnams/v2.0/create-a-new-cnam-record/). In the example below, we reuse the `random_generator()` function to generate a four-character random string which we will concatenate with FR and assign as our CNAM value.
    
##### Example Request
```
# Helper function for random strings
def random_generator(size=4, chars=string.ascii_uppercase + string.digits):
    return ''.join(random.choice(chars) for x in range(size))

print("\n--Create a CNAM Record")
cnam_value = 'FR ' + random_generator()
result = cnams_controller.create_cnam_record(cnam_value)
pprint.pprint(result)
print("\nNOTE: Newly created CNAM records need to be approved first before they can be associated with your long code number.")
```

##### Example Response

On success, the HTTP status code in the response header is `201 Created` and the response body contains the newly created cnam object in JSON format.

```

```
#### associate_cnam(cnam_id, number_id)

The method accepts a CNAM record ID and a phone number as parameters which you can learn more about in the [API reference](https://developer.flowroute.com/api/cnams/v2.0/assign-cnam-record-to-phone-number/). In the following example, we will call `list_account_phone_numbers()` and associate the first number in the returned array with our previously assigned `cnam_id`.
    
##### Example Request
```
print("\n--Associate a CNAM Record to a DID")
our_numbers = numbers_controller.list_account_phone_numbers()
did_id = our_numbers['data'][0]['id']

if cnam_id is None:
    print("Create some CNAM records and wait for approval before trying"
          " to associate them with a DID")
else:
    result = cnams_controller.associate_cnam(cnam_id, did_id)
    pprint.pprint(result)
```

##### Example Response
On success, the HTTP status code in the response header is `202 Accepted` and the response body contains an attributes dictionary containing the `date_created` field and the assigned cnam object in JSON format. This request will fail if the CNAM you are trying to associate has not yet been approved.
```
--Associate a CNAM Record to a DID
{'data': {'attributes': {'date_created': 'Fri, 01 Jun 2018 00:17:52 GMT'},
          'id': 17604,
          'type': 'cnam'}}
```
#### unassociate_cnam(number_id)

The method accepts a phone number as a parameter which you can learn more about in the [API reference](https://developer.flowroute.com/api/cnams/v2.0/unassign-a-cnam-record-from-phone-number/). In the following example, we will disassociate the same phone number that we've used in `associate_cnam()`.
    
##### Example Request
```
print("\n--Unassociate a CNAM Record from a DID")
result = cnams_controller.unassociate_cnam(did_id)
pprint.pprint(result)
```

##### Example Response
On success, the HTTP status code in the response header is `202 Accepted` and the response body contains an attributes object with the date the CNAM was requested to be deleted, and the updated cnam object in JSON format.

```
--Unassociate a CNAM Record from a DID
{'data': {'attributes': {'date_created': 'Fri, 01 Jun 2018 00:17:52 GMT'},
          'id': None,
          'type': 'cnam'}}
```
#### remove_cnam(cnam_id)

The method accepts a CNAM record ID as a parameter which you can learn more about in the [API reference](https://developer.flowroute.com/api/cnams/v2.0/remove-cnam-record-from-account/). In the following example, we will be deleting our previously extracted `cnam_id` from the "List Approved CNAM Records" function call.
    
##### Example Request
```
print("\n--Remove a CNAM Record from your account")
result = cnams_controller.remove_cnam(cnam_id)
pprint.pprint(result)
```

##### Example Response
On success, the HTTP status code in the response header is `204 No Content` which means that the server successfully processed the request and is not returning any content.

```
--Remove a CNAM Record from your account
''
```

#### Errors

In cases of method errors, the Python library raises an exception which includes an error message and the HTTP body that was received in the request. 

##### Example Error
` raise ErrorException('403 Forbidden â The server understood the request but refuses to authorize it.', _context) `
 
## Testing
